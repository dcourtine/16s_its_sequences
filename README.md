# 16s_its_sequences
This directory summarize the framework used to sequence, check and assemble 16SrRNA-ITS sequences.
Different assembly where performed. One for each seqeuncing batch.

## Description of the data used
### List of the different sequencing invoices

#### December 2015
Few months after the start of my thesis, I first finish 16S sequences produced by Nolwen Leost during her intership \(DUT, from April to June 2014\).
I had sequencing runs produced with primers A8F and A1492R on 96 _Thermococcales_ strains in theory.
Due to assembly failure with those 2 runs, I used a new sequencing run with the primer A958R to assemble the full 16S sequence. 

#### March 2016
This sequencing run dealt with 96 strains and the A71R primer.
Strains was the one sequenced by Nolwen (A8F - A1492R) and Damien (A958R)

##### Note about these data (December 2015 / March 2016)
The majority of strains were sequenced with the 4 primers, but it was not the case for some of them.
The table bellow summarize the differences between these 4 sequencing runs
